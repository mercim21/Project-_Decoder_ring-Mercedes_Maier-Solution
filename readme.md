# Decoder Functions: Caesar Shift, Polybius and Substitution
This project was done for Thinkful and to test our abilities to use Chai and tests to use the functions for these deciphering codes. 

## 1.Caesar Shift

In this code we explore how we can decipher a message from shifting the start of the letters to be given a different value. As you can see from this image this is what it is trying to accomplish. 
Below is how the code is put to use

Caesar Shift (Substitution Cipher) - 
A Caesar Shift cipher is a type of mono-alphabetic substitution cipher where each letter of the plain text is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, letter A would be replaced by letter B, letter B would be replaced by letter C, and so on.

As you can see the message can either be coded or decoded and the shift number aids in how many letters over (right or left) to reveal the secret message. This function was done to mimic Julius Ceasar cipher.

## 2. Polybius
